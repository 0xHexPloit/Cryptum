# Cryptum

This project consists of a CLI program written in Rust that allows either encrypting or signing data using lattice-based cryptography. For the encryption part, the `Kyber` algorithm ([article](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/634.pdf)) has been used. For the signature algorithm, we opted for the `Dilithium` algorithm ([article](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/633.pdf)).
